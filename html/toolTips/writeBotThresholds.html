<div style="width:30em">
    <div class="Summary">Writes high/low value to a file where the bot can pick it up
    </div>
    <div class="Example">Say you sold at 1$, you want to rebuy at 0.97$, or at 1.03 if the prices continues to rise
        <P />
        Now the price drops continually. At 0.98 you decide to lower your upper limit to 1.01$.
        <p />So you would only make 1% loss if the price rises
        <P />
        Say you lower your buy order to 0.95 and the price continues to drop. Tell you bot to buy high at 0.98, which is
        still 2% profit
    </div>
    <div class="Attention">ATTENTION: This does NOT affect the existing buy order! You need to lower/change the price
        there
        manually</div>
